Has had covid
  lost two weeks to ill health
  back working on project


Nothing received prior to meeting


How did the interviews go on 9 Jul?
  waiting on outcome for all three
  has some more interviews this week


How has he been getting on?
  writing?
    working on literature review
    sent me a draft; much improved but not complete
    I will comment on the draft
  coding?
    hasn't been able to make any progress on this


Is he still coding in python?
  does he plan to complete work in python?
    will switch back to Java
  can I have access to his GitHub repository?
    open access: https://github.com/codeitright98/Bat-Optimization-Algorithm


How is the scope?
  could cut binary BA if necessary
  focus on comparison of continuous BA
  make decision at next superv (18 Aug)

    allows switching between algorithms
    all the algorithms must be carefully matched to papers
    apply the algorithms to a set of benchmarks
    be careful - there may be too many variants to deal with all in detail
draft chapter on continuous
methodology, analysis & discussion


Submission date:
  16 Sep
  will he apply for LA?
    he should, given the illness - try for two weeks' LA
  some people have been denied for general applications
  LA prob more use than PEC, but apply for PEC if LA denied


Supervisor availability:
  holiday 31 July - 15 Aug; 23 - 30 Aug
  future supervisions: 18 Aug; circa 1 Sep; circa 9 Sep
    if an LA is granted, will be at least one more supervision
  must get chapters in time to give comments so you can revise
  need a plan for when chapters will come in
    introduction
    lit review
    methodology
    analysis & discussion
    conclusion & further work
alternative, put the continuous and binary BAs in separate chapters, each of which contains methodology, analysis & discussion


Next meeting: 2:00-2:25pm on Wed 18 Aug (Mon and Tue looking too busy)


Date: 03/09/2021


Supervision postponed from 18 Aug


How are you? How was trip to India?
  spent one week in India


Have you applied for LA/PEC?
  any outcome?
  LA - needed PL approval, and received it
  will receive the new date in the coming week via student portal
  delayed submission will probably result in a delay to the confirmation of the degree
  still waiting for a response to the PEC


How is the project progressing?
  email on 18 Aug
    finished coding & methodology on continuous BA
    finished coding & methodology on binary BA


Discuss how to present results
  multiple (10) runs
  only vary one aspect
  compare mean and best
  do significance testing
  pairwise sign testing
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_test
Nithesh is familiar with SPSS - good choice for significance testing


When can I expect to see more draft material?
  only seen and commented on 5 pages of lit review
  Nithesh will send some additional chapters for comment by the end of today


Before next time:
  try and send additional material for comment by end of Wed 8 Sep


Next meeting: 11:30-11:55am on Fri 10 Sep


Date: 16/09/2021


Comments returned on two drafts prior to meeting
  plagiarism problem with methodology
  Nithesh says that he sent the file by mistake, and it was copied from a PhD that he found on the internet
  I reiterated the importance of doing his own work for the project report, and also the use of Turnitin for plagiarism detection


I need to see methodology and results
  for the continuous BA, need a methodology that presents the base equations for BA, then shows, against citations, the distinct variants
  each needs to be clearly labelled (given a name) and the differences expressed as equations and ideally diagrams
  the methodology needs to introduce the selected benchmarks (from cited papers); give them as descriptions, equations, and diagrams
  then in the results, apply the different variants to benchmark problems and show what differences if any there are between the approaches with statistical significance analysis (best, mean, statistical significance)


Before next meeting (by 22 Sep at latest):
  draft methodology for continuous BA including variants and benchmarks (equations, diagrams)


Submission
  formal submission 30 Sep
  Nithesh has been told he will get an extra two weeks on this (14 Oct)


Next meeting: 11:30-11:55am on Thu 23 Sep


Date: 23/09/2021


Nothing received before the meeting
latest methodology draft received by Teams chat


Submission
  Nithesh will presumably be aiming for 14 Oct
  Nithesh will in fact be expected to submit on 30 Sep with the rest of the cohort
  He will aim to meet the deadline


Viva:
  First 30 mins is student; 15 mins presentation; 15 mins Q&A
  15 mins for examiners at the end
   For presentation: PowerPoint - high-level, interesting overview
   assume we have read the report: what are the best bits the interesting bits
    this is a sales pitch!
    make sure to rehearse it
    do not go over time
    Q&A will be mainly second examiner
Second examiner: Ahmed Bouridane
possibly w/c 4 Oct, more likely w/c 11 Oct


Drafts so far
literature Review - comments given
methodology for continuous BA
still missing: abstract, introduction, results on continuous , discussion/evaluation, conclusions and further work
maybe not including: methodology for binary, results for binary
consider leaving out binary BA from both methodology and results if necessary - you must complete the work you have done and write it up well
partially complete binary should stay in lit review, and be written up as incomplete in discussion/evaluation and future work - talk about your own experimental work and link the ideas to the literature
it is in your interest to give me drafts of all chapters for comment, but I need time to turn these round ... give them to me as early as possible


Need to submit an evidence folder - cloud-based folder that you send the link to both examiners - readme file (briefly describe what is included in each folder), folder with emails with my project supervision notes, links to the GitHub repositories, raw experimental results


Advise making the draft submission a couple of days before the real one to check the Turnitin score


Aiming for a full draft by Saturday.


This will be our last supervision
